      "message": "A lot of effort to support both the kdump path and the new BMC dump path. I wonder if it would have been better to just switch to the BMC dump path since no one is using the kdump path? vs. trying to plumb it all in and make the code so much more complex.",

      "message": "Well, part of the process was keeping the patches reviewable. Wholesale replacing what was there with what we needed would have been pretty difficult to break up in a meaningful way.\n\nAlso the original source and sink implementation keep the core behaviour of the application easily testable.\n\nFurther, this change decouples us from the debug-trigger policy implemented in openbmc/openbmc - we just have to drop in a different environment file to switch over whenever the code gets merged.",
