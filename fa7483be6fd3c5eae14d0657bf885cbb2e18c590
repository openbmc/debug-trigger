I guess this is a c++-averse repo? I feel like sdbusplus offers a lot simpler (and more familiar code) to most of us in OpenBMC.",

These functions are normally only called as last step of shutdown, and should not be called directly.\" I assume given the special circumstances here, you want this \"hard reboot\" behavior? The BMC state code calls the reboot.target and passes the replace-irreversibly option to ensure it doesn\u0027t get interrupted.",
